# Space Apps Challenges: Will It Rain On My Parade?

## Project overview

Our project is a web-based probabilistic weather prediction application which provides the user with a dashboard to compute the probability of their desired weather conditions for a given day and suggests an alternative date if the probability of the event is below a certain threshold.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Project description

The "Will It Rain On My Parade?" application is a web-based tool designed to provide users with probabilistic weather predictions. The application will consist of several key components:

* Data Acquisition: We download and store meteorological data from NASA's MERRA-2, specifically the M2T1NXSLV and M2T1NXFLX collections. The variables we selected will serve as the foundation for our model.
* Data Processing and Cleaning: Implement data cleaning techniques using pandas to remove any garbage values, handle missing datapoints, and ensure the dataset is structured for analysis.
* Feature Engineering: We create features from the cleaned and discretized data, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation categories.
* Model Development: We use bnlearn to fit the data to a Bayesian Network using Hill Climbing and BIC scoring. This model will be trained on the processed data to compute the probability of desired weather conditions.
* User Interface Development: We utilize Streamlit to create a frontend dashboard where users can input a target date and location alongside their desired weather conditions.
* Probability Computation: We calculate the likelihood of the specified conditions for the given date and location using the Bayesian model and present the results in an easy-to-understand format.
* Alternative Date Suggestions: If the probability is below a specified threshold, the application will analyze nearby dates and suggest alternatives that are closer to the desired weather criteria.
* Multi-Day Event Support: We allow users to select date ranges for events and provide suggestions for these periods, enhancing functionality for more complex planning scenarios.

## üéØ Goals

1. Process, clean and store NASA meteorological data
2. Build and fit a probabilistic model (Bayesian Network) with the cleaned data
3. Provide a user-friendly interface where the user can input their desired weather conditions for a given day of the year and return its computed probability
4. Suggest days closer to the desired weather conditions in a time window around the initial desired date
5. Allow the user to select date ranges for multi-day events
6. Suggest a date range closer to the desired weather conditions in a time window around the initial desired date range
